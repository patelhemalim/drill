            <article>United States, officially United States of America, abbreviated U.S. or U.S.A., byname America,
                country
                in North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the
                middle
                latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme
                of
                North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are
                bounded
                on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and
                Mexico,
                and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in
                area
                (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the
                District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.
